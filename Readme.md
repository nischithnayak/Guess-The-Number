# How It Works
The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
The player is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the game provides feedback:
If the guess is correct, the player wins!
If the guess is too high or too low, the game provides a hint.
The player can choose to quit the game at any time by entering Q.
